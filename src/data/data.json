        "p1": "You have to attend an important conference in Miami. You and your team have been preparing for a really long time and everything has to be perfect — from the presentation, speech, dress code, appearance… Everybody knows that first impressions are important and after all this, you are getting in front of the 5* hotel in a 12 years old green Toyota Corolla with your baggage, suitcase and the laptop bag in hands, maybe 10 minutes late because the internet connection was bad or the driver got lost. Dont get me wrong, I have a 2014 Honda in the garage, but some things just dont get along.",
        "p2": "You have to attend an important conference in Miami. You and your team have been preparing for a really long time and everything has to be perfect — from the presentation, speech, dress code, appearance… Everybody knows that first impression is important and after all this, you are getting in front of the 5* hotel in black Cadillac Escalade, your personal chauffeur is getting out of the car, opens the door for you, bringing your baggage to the front desk, you are feeling like you own the place, and that the conference is just a piece of cake. You must be thinking now: yes sure, we all know that limo is better, but its much more expensive than Uber! Please continue reading: Ride costs: An average Uber ride from Miami airport to South Beach hotels during the week costs approximately $20–25, depending on the part of the day. Limo service from Miami airport to hotels in South Beach during the week costs approximately $80, and it doesnt depend on the part of the day. Actually it doesnt depend on whether it's the weekend or business hours. In fact, even the distance is irrelevant — it is the same expense if you are riding for 10 minutes or 45 minutes.",
        "p3": "Who is your driver? Everybody can drive Uber. All you need to sign in and thats it. Limo drivers are highly professional and trained , with more than 3 years of experience in driving limo, dressed in suits as a work uniform.",
        "p4": "A car younger than 2006 or Cadillac Escalade? With the Uber service, you never know which vehicle is going to pick you up, is it clean, is it spacious and there is always the possibility for the driver to cancel the ride. Limo service allows you to choose what type of vehicle you want , it is always perfectly clean with a bottle of cold water for every passenger. Once you book the ride, there is no option of delay or cancellation.",
        "p5": "Treat yourself, you deserve it: You use Uber just to get from point A to point B, and thats it. With Limo service, you get a full experience. Comfort is guaranteed with SUV vehicles, you dont have to worry about heavy baggage or if all your bags are going to fit in the car — a personal chauffeur is taking care of everything.",
        "p6": "Anything you need: Uber service doesnt provide any extra amenities except transportation.
